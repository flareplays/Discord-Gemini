# Discord-Gemini
A Discord self bot integration of Google Gemini. The code is pretty sloppy but its mostly a proof of concept.
SELF BOTS ARE NOT ALLOWED ON DISCORD
THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT


Setup
This will require some light knowledge on python and a little bit of research on self bots
1. Install langchain
2. Install discord.py api and discord.py-self api
3. install the gemini api
4. make a google gemini account and get a gemini key
5. add that key to the file
6. make a discord account for the self bot and get its token
7. add the token to the file
8. Run the file and it should work
If there are any issues please let me know. I am pretty new to python.
